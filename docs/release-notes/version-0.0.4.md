# Release Notes - Version 0.0.4

## Overview
Version 0.0.4 brings significant performance improvements, better memory efficiency, enhanced testing infrastructure, and important bug fixes to the Proxy-Wasm Java Host implementation.

## ðŸš€ New Features

### Optimizations
- **Lazy Request Body Loading**: Refactored request body handling so that it's not loaded into memory unless the WASM Pluign needs it
- **Lazy Response Body Loading**: Refactored response body handling so that it's not loaded into memory unless the WASM Pluign needs it.
- **Lazy Plugin Startup**: WASM modules now don't get started, until the a request needs to use the module.  

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- **TomEE Integration Tests**: Added a comprehensive TomEE integration test module to ensure compatibility with TomEE application server
- **Improved Build Configuration**: Enhanced build setup and configuration management

### Runtime Upgrades
- **Chicory Runtime v1.4.0**: Upgraded to the latest Chicory WASM runtime for improved performance and stability

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

- **Plugin Builder Relocation**: **BREAKING CHANGE** - Moved the builder from the `Plugin` class to the `PluginFactory` class. This change improves the API design but requires code updates:
  
  **Before:**
  ```java
  () -> Plugin.builder(module)
      .withName("waf")
      .build();
  ```
  
  **After:**
  ```java
  PluginFactory.builder(module)
      .withName("waf")
      .build();
  ```


## ðŸ”§ Improvements
